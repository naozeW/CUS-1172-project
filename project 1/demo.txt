      <p>
      I like a wide range of music styles, whether it is classical music, blues, rock, pop, folk music, military music, and any interesting style. In terms of listening frequency, the most concentrated in the 1950s to 1990s rock music.
      I want to share one of my favorite music pieces here, which is from my favorite anime: Star Cowboy ï¼šGotta Knock a Little Harder - Seatbelts COWBOY BEBOP.
